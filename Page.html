        </h2>
    <p class="description">The fitness industry is quite popular in modern times and very often people who had nothing to do with sports, coming to a fitness club,
        do not understand what the first workout in the gym should be like.
        A person, for the first time, being in a hall with a huge amount of equipment, feels discomfort from the fact that
        that he sees many different simulators and does not know which one to take,
        and, having taken it, risks injuring himself due to incorrect technique of performing exercises.</p>
        <h2>WHERE TO START YOUR TRAINING?</h2>
        <p> Novice athletes, after watching videos on the Internet and listening to the advice of inexperienced athletes, 
            take on all the simulators in a row, while not observing the technique. 
            It is better to go through the first workout with a professional instructor, 
            he will tell you about each simulator and its proper operation, 
            as well as tell you about the muscle groups involved in a particular simulator. 
            The instructor will conduct an introductory briefing, increasing both the quality and safety of your training.
            If you nevertheless decide to conduct a workout on your own, then, firstly, 
            use only those simulators about which you have at least heard something. 
            Secondly, work with light weight, it is much more important to master the technique than to 
            get injured chasing weight. Thirdly, select one muscle group, for example, the chest, 
            and perform exercises only on this muscle group. In the second session you can do the back, 
            and in the third session you can do the biceps and triceps, and finally, in the fourth session, 
            the legs and shoulders.</p>
            <h2>COMMON MISTAKE DURING TRAINING</h2>
            <p>As the proverb says, "You learn from your mistakes." 
                But in this case, it is traumatic! Very often, newcomers come to the gym, already, as they consider, savvy. 
                They studied the training programs of their idols, for example, C.T. Fletcher or Arnold Schwarzenegger, and, 
                without hesitation, they begin to perform these exercises. But this cannot be done for several reasons:
                Bodybuilder training programs are individually compiled for each individual case, and besides, 
                bodybuilders share far from all the tips and their workouts are constantly changing depending on the situation.
                Professional bodybuilders are on steroids, and it is easier for them to build muscle no matter what exercises 
                they perform. Also, dear novice athletes should not chase weight and sit all day in the gym, 
                trying to prepare for the beach season! Firstly, without calculating your strength and taking on a 
                lot of weight, you risk getting injured rather than pumping up a conditional biceps, and secondly, 
                by training all day in the gym, you donâ€™t let your muscles rest, and muscles, as you know, grow after 
                training ! Remember that in a couple of weeks of intensive work, 
                you will not make the figure of your dreams, but you will give a good start for the future! 
                The first workout in the gym is symbolic, but already in it you create the foundation for the future. 
                Work rationally, but effectively, and one wonderful day you will see the fruits of your labor.</p>
                <h2>HEALTHY WEIGHT</h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of healthy weight in relation to height is associated with an assessment of a person's physical fitness and general health. 
                    It is important to understand that healthy weight can vary greatly depending on individual factors such as genetics, age, physical activity level and metabolism.
                    Here you can also find a table of weight in relation to height.
